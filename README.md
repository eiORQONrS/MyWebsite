## How content is organized

Everything you might want to edit lives in plain files. **You should never need to touch component code to update content.**

| What you want to change | File to edit |
|--|--|
| Bio, photo, name, CV link, nav, footer | `src/config.ts` |
| Add / edit a publication | `src/content/publications/*.md` (one file per paper) |
| Add / edit a fun project | `src/content/projects/*.md` |
| Site colors, fonts, spacing | `src/styles/global.css` (CSS variables at the top) |

### Adding a new publication

Create a new file in `src/content/publications/`, e.g. `00-new-paper.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Paper Title Here"
authors: "Author One, **Yanjun Chen**, Author Three"
venue: "CHI 2026: ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"
year: 2026
order: 0          # lower number = appears higher on the page
paperUrl: "/uploads/your-paper.pdf"
doiUrl: "https://doi.org/..."
videoUrl: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."
previewVideo: "/uploads/your-preview.mp4"
---
```

- Wrap your own name in `**double asterisks**` to bold it in the author list.
- `order: 0` puts it at the top. Existing papers go from `order: 1` (newest) downward.
- Drop the PDF and preview video into `public/uploads/`.
- Any of the URL fields can be omitted — buttons only show if a URL is set.

### Adding a fun project

Same idea, in `src/content/projects/`:

```markdown
---
title: "Project Name"
venue: "Some Conference 2025"
year: 2025
order: 0
image: "/uploads/your-image.jpg"
award: "🏆 Best Demo"   # optional
---
```

## Migrating content from the old WordPress site

Your existing PDFs, videos, and images currently live at
`https://chen-yanjun.com/wp-content/uploads/...` and `https://chen-yanjun.com/uploads/...`.

1. Download everything from the old site's `/uploads/` and `/wp-content/uploads/` folders.
2. Drop the files into this repo's `public/uploads/` folder.
3. The Markdown files already reference them at `/uploads/<filename>` — no path changes needed.

You also need a profile photo (`me.png`) and favicon (`favicon.png`) in `public/`.

### Tip: shrink those preview videos

The original site serves preview clips as full-size `.mp4`. Re-encode to ~720p and a few seconds long to keep page loads snappy:

```bash
# Example using ffmpeg
ffmpeg -i original.mp4 -t 6 -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -an preview.mp4
```

A 1–2 MB preview file is plenty.

## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

1. Push this repo to GitHub (or GitLab).
2. Go to [Cloudflare Pages dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → **Create a project** → connect to your repo.
3. Use these build settings:
   - **Framework preset**: Astro
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: `20` (set under environment variables: `NODE_VERSION=20`)
4. Click **Save and Deploy**. First build takes ~1 minute.
5. In **Custom domains**, add `chen-yanjun.com` and `www.chen-yanjun.com`.
   - Cloudflare will guide you through DNS setup. If your domain is already on Cloudflare, this is one click.

After this, every `git push` to your main branch automatically rebuilds and deploys the site.

## Stack

- **Astro 4** — static site generator. Outputs zero JS by default.
- **No CSS framework** — plain CSS with custom properties. ~5 KB gzipped.
- **No client-side JavaScript** — except inline `onmouseover` for video hover previews.
- **Total build output** for a site this size: well under 100 KB of HTML/CSS (videos and PDFs excluded).

## Why this is easier to maintain than WordPress

- No database, no PHP, no plugin updates, no security patches.
- Adding a paper = creating one Markdown file and `git push`.
- Versioned in git — full history of every edit.
- Free hosting on Cloudflare Pages with global CDN.
